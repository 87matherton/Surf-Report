  - Wind conditions (offshore vs onshore)
  - Weather conditions (temperature, precipitation)
  - Swell direction and period
  - Tide conditions
- **Visual quality indicators** on map markers
- **Color-coded scoring system**:
  - 🟢 8-10: Excellent (Green)
  - 🔵 6-8: Good (Blue) 
  - 🟠 4-6: Fair (Orange)
  - 🔴 0-4: Poor (Red)
- **Real-time quality updates** with automatic refresh
- **Quality-based recommendations** for each spot
