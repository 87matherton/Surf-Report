### Quality Scoring Algorithm
```
Wave Height (30%): Optimal range based on spot characteristics
Wind Speed (25%): Lower is better (offshore preferred)
Swell Period (25%): Longer periods score higher
Direction (20%): Matches spot's optimal swell/wind directions
```

### Real-time Updates
- Live status indicators (green dot = fresh data)
- Loading animations during updates
